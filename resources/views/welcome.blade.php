                        Help Me! is free to use, and no signup is required, students can click
                        of the student link above, and connect with the student code provided
                        by your tutor. Tutors can click the tutor link above, enter the class
                        details, and give out the provided student code to the class

                        Help Me! was designed to allow tutors to more effectively and fairly
                        assist students. With Help Me!, tutors can use a computer or mobile
                        device to view a list of students who need help, in the order that
                        they requested it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Help Me! avoid the problem of tutors not being able to keep track 
                        of who needs help, and when, especially in large classes, and 
                        makes sure students are assisted in order, and as soon as possible
                        after they ask for help, maximising their productivity by reducing 
                        their downtime, and helping them reach their potential.
